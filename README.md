# Python Project on Terrorism Analysis
A complete Data Analysis on Terrorism using Dash and Plotly. This project gives a clear visualisation of all the different terrorist attacks held from 1970 - 2018 across all over the world and Specially a complete comparison between India and World in Terrorism. The Project is been made worked in a very dynamic format with all the dynamic visualisations into it along with the core insights for someone to search for. It tells us how one can do a complete visualisation even with Dash and plotly dynamically.
                                      Being a good programmer helps a learner to prepare data better for analysis and allows to quickly deploy models. Following concepts are covered in this project:

1.Fundamentals of Python language
2.Object-Oriented Programming 
3.Concepts of defining functions and conditional statements 
3.Data Wrangling with Pandas
4.Visualizing Data using Dash and Plotly
